# Export Function

## Export Prices

The Pricing module includes Export functionality, which allows the user to export data using different export criteria. Two types of data objects are allowed to be exported from Pricing module:

1. Price lists;
1. Price list assignments.

The user can start the data export simply by selecting the data object and going through a very simple and intuitive wizard. The Export function is integrated with the Pricing Module and provided out-of-the-box. The screenshots bellow show the main steps of the data export in Pricing module:
