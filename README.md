The **Pricing Module** is designed for storing, managing and evaluating product prices.

The Pricing Module is consisted of three main objects:

1. Price
1. Price list
1. Price list Assignment

### Price

The purpose of this object is to store the item price in the system and support a static discount and a tier price. The price has the following key characteristics:

- **Product** (required) - is an object that the current price relates to.
- **List price** (required) – represents the base price for the product in currency of owned price. The List price is a pre-promotional regular price.  
- **Sale price** (optional) – is the discounted price of an item from the regular sale price.
- **Min quantity** (min. 1) – represents lower inclusive limit for products quantity starting from which, this price will be valid. The min QTY is used for achieving Tier pricing functionality.

### Pricelist

The Pricelist plays the role of a container for prices with single currency. The Pricelist has the following key characteristics:

- **Currency** (required) – single currency for all prices included into the Price list.  
- **Prices** – the list of prices included into the Price list.  

### Pricelist Assignment

The Pricelist Assignment allows associating the specific Pricelist with a catalog based on specific rules and conditions.  

The Pricelist Assignment has the following key characteristics:

- **Pricelist** (required) - relation to selected pricelist.  
- **Catalog** (required) - relation to selected catalog.
- **Enable** (start) and **Expiration dates** – the specified Enabled and Expiration dates determine the validation period of the pricelist assignment.  
- **Priority**  defines the priority of the Pricelist. The system will apply the pricelist that has the highest priority.  
- **Dynamic Assignment** of applicability.

## Key Features

1. The system supports static discounts on products and allows the user to specify the discount on each item on the list.
1. In order to make the **Pricelists** active, it should be assigned to a specific **Catalog** in the system. The system allows the user to specify specific rules and conditions that can also be assigned to the **Pricelists**. These specific rules and conditions will influence the price calculation and define to which user categories or Organizations the pricelist will be displayed. This is a so-called **Dynamic Assignment**.
1. The system allows expanding the **Dynamic Assignment** tree and it completely depends on the organization business needs. Any condition or rule can be added without changing the Module logic.
